   <h1>Design - Analysis Assessment</h1>
   <h2><a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/index.html">Bose Corporation</a></h2>
   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;
    <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for proximity -->
   </h3>
   <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">
   <p>
    <!-- Replace this comment with the copy (text) explaining how proximity is being used in the image. -->

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;

   <p>
   In this website you can see a combination of centered and left alignment. Centered alignment helps the reader 
   to visualize easily very short paragraphs and pictures of the products in the website. Moreover, left side alignment 
   helps the user to understand better what are some of the characteristics and prices of each item becuase of their wider message.

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;

   </h3>

   <p>
    You can see a lot of repetition of colors and sizes in this website. Through colors, Bose always use the colors black and white
    in their websites, logo, advertisements, etc. When you navigate on their page you can easily tell that it comes from Bose because 
    of the repetition they used in their colors. Also, the separation of each product is the same, which helps the viewer to see a lot
    of different options of the items Bose is offering.
